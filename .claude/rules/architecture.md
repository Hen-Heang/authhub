# Architecture Rule

Full detail: `docs/architecture.md`.

- Dependency direction is one-way and must never cycle:
  `common-api` → `security-api` → `todoapi`.
- `common-api` has no bootJar and isn't runnable — it's the shared library
  (`ApiResponse`/`ApiStatus`/`StatusCode`, pagination, enum converters,
  interceptors). Everything else depends on it, never the reverse.
- `security-api` (port 8080) is the auth service. `todoapi` (port 8082) is a
  sample business API secured by `security-api`'s JWT — it may depend on
  `security-api`, not vice versa.
- `legacy/spring-jwt-auth/` is archived, not in `settings.gradle`, not part
  of the build. Reference only — don't extend it, don't wire it back in.
- Shared dependency versions/plugin config live once in the root
  `build.gradle`'s `subprojects {}` block — don't repeat them per-module.
- Before adding a new module or cross-module call, check this direction
  holds; if a change would require `common-api` or `security-api` to depend
  on something downstream, stop and flag it rather than introducing the
  cycle.
